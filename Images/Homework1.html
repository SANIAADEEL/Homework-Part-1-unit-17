        <p>A Design professional passionate about building digital solutions using a innovative, user-centric design approach. Strengths in leadership, teamwork, design innovation and communication to help bring ideas to life from ideation to execution</p>.
        <p>A background in Fashion design and UX/UI allows me to bring my creativity, knack for modern design principles and analytical thinking to be a highly valuable addition to people I work with.</p>
            
            <p>I have spent the past 10 years in the design field, refining the approach to empathize with clients and brands, while developing my ideation skills to build solutions to various problems. My past as a fashion designer helped me nurture my creativity in challenging situations and helped me build transferrable skills, that made my transition into UI/UX easier. Now, I strive to validate my research and the subsequent solutions - iterating in an endless loop until I’m able to drastically improve the user’s experience.</p> 
            
            <p>Other than being a user experience designer, I am an  illustrator, an enthusiastic traveler who has travelled to 10+ countries and 30+ cities, and an amateur photographer.
